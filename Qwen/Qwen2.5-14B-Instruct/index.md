# Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct

## Introduction

Qwen2.5 is the latest series of Qwen large language models. For Qwen2.5, we release a number of base language models and instruction-tuned language models ranging from 0.5 to 72 billion parameters. Qwen2.5 brings the following improvements upon Qwen2:

- Significantly **more knowledge** and has greatly improved capabilities in **coding** and **mathematics**, thanks to our specialized expert models in these domains.
- Significant improvements in **instruction following**, **generating long texts** (over 8K tokens), **understanding structured data** (e.g, tables), and **generating structured outputs** especially JSON. **More resilient to the diversity of system prompts**, enhancing role-play implementation and condition-setting for chatbots.
- **Long-context Support** up to 128K tokens and can generate up to 8K tokens.
- **Multilingual support** for over 29 languages, including Chinese, English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, Arabic, and more. 

**This repo contains the instruction-tuned 14B Qwen2.5 model**, which has the following features:
- Type: Causal Language Models
- Training Stage: Pretraining & Post-training
- Architecture: transformers with RoPE, SwiGLU, RMSNorm, and Attention QKV bias
- Number of Parameters: 14.7B
- Number of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 13.1B
- Number of Layers: 48
- Number of Attention Heads (GQA): 40 for Q and 8 for KV
- Context Length: Full 131,072 tokens and generation 8192 tokens
  - Please refer to [this section](#processing-long-texts) for detailed instructions on how to deploy Qwen2.5 for handling long texts.

For more details, please refer to our [blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5/), [GitHub](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5), and [Documentation](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Requirements

The code of Qwen2.5 has been in the latest Hugging face `transformers` and we advise you to use the latest version of `transformers`.

With `transformers<4.37.0`, you will encounter the following error:
```
KeyError: 'qwen2'
```

## Quickstart

Here provides a code snippet with `apply_chat_template` to show you how to load the tokenizer and model and how to generate contents.

```python
from paddlenlp.transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "qwen/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct"

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

prompt = "Give me a short introduction to large language model."
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud. You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
]
text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True
)
model_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pd")

generated_ids = model.generate(
    **model_inputs,
    max_new_tokens=512
)[0]
generated_ids = [
    output_ids[len(input_ids):] for input_ids, output_ids in zip(model_inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)
]

response = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
print(response)
```

### Processing Long Texts

The current `config.json` is set for context length up to 32,768 tokens.
To handle extensive inputs exceeding 32,768 tokens, we utilize [YaRN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00071), a technique for enhancing model length extrapolation, ensuring optimal performance on lengthy texts.

For supported frameworks, you could add the following to `config.json` to enable YaRN:
```json
{
  ...,
  "rope_scaling": {
    "factor": 4.0,
    "original_max_position_embeddings": 32768,
    "type": "yarn"
  }
}
```

For deployment, we recommend using vLLM. 
Please refer to our [Documentation](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment/vllm.html) for usage if you are not familar with vLLM.
Presently, vLLM only supports static YARN, which means the scaling factor remains constant regardless of input length, **potentially impacting performance on shorter texts**. 
We advise adding the `rope_scaling` configuration only when processing long contexts is required.

## Evaluation & Performance

Detailed evaluation results are reported in this [ðŸ“‘ blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5/).
