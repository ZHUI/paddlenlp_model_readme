# Qwen2.5-Coder-7B

## Introduction

Qwen2.5-Coder is the latest series of Code-Specific Qwen large language models (formerly known as CodeQwen). For Qwen2.5-Coder, we release three base language models and instruction-tuned language models, 1.5, 7 and 32 (coming soon) billion parameters. Qwen2.5-Coder brings the following improvements upon CodeQwen1.5:

- Significantly improvements in **code generation**, **code reasoning** and **code fixing**. Base on the strong Qwen2.5, we scale up the training tokens into 5.5 trillion including source code, text-code grounding, Synthetic data, etc. 
- A more comprehensive foundation for real-world applications such as **Code Agents**. Not only enhancing coding capabilities but also maintaining its strengths in mathematics and general competencies.
- **Long-context Support** up to 128K tokens.


**This repo contains the 7B Qwen2.5-Coder model**, which has the following features:
- Type: Causal Language Models
- Training Stage: Pretraining & Post-training
- Architecture: transformers with RoPE, SwiGLU, RMSNorm, and Attention QKV bias
- Number of Parameters: 7.61B
- Number of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 6.53B
- Number of Layers: 28
- Number of Attention Heads (GQA): 28 for Q and 4 for KV
- Context Length: Full 131,072 tokens
  - Please refer to [this section](#processing-long-texts) for detailed instructions on how to deploy Qwen2.5 for handling long texts.
  
**We do not recommend using base language models for conversations.** Instead, you can apply post-training, e.g., SFT, RLHF, continued pretraining, etc., or fill in the middle tasks on this model.

For more details, please refer to our [blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-coder/), [GitHub](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-Coder), and [Documentation](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Requirements

The code of Qwen2.5-Coder has been in the latest Hugging face `transformers` and we advise you to use the latest version of `transformers`.

With `transformers<4.37.0`, you will encounter the following error:
```
KeyError: 'qwen2'
```

### Processing Long Texts

The current `config.json` is set for context length up to 32,768 tokens.
To handle extensive inputs exceeding 32,768 tokens, we utilize [YaRN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00071), a technique for enhancing model length extrapolation, ensuring optimal performance on lengthy texts.

For supported frameworks, you could add the following to `config.json` to enable YaRN:
```json
{
  ...,
  "rope_scaling": {
    "factor": 4.0,
    "original_max_position_embeddings": 32768,
    "type": "yarn"
  }
}
```

For deployment, we recommend using vLLM. 
Please refer to our [Documentation](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment/vllm.html) for usage if you are not familar with vLLM.
Presently, vLLM only supports static YARN, which means the scaling factor remains constant regardless of input length, **potentially impacting performance on shorter texts**. 
We advise adding the `rope_scaling` configuration only when processing long contexts is required.

## Evaluation & Performance

Detailed evaluation results are reported in this [ðŸ“‘ blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-coder/).

For requirements on GPU memory and the respective throughput, see results [here](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/benchmark/speed_benchmark.html).
