# ddim-butterflies-128

## Model description

This diffusion model is trained with the [ðŸ¤— Diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) library 
on the `huggan/smithsonian_butterflies_subset` dataset.

## Intended uses & limitations

#### How to use

```python
# TODO: add an example code snippet for running this diffusion pipeline
```

#### Limitations and bias

[TODO: provide examples of latent issues and potential remediations]

## Training data

[TODO: describe the data used to train the model]

- eval_batch_size: 32
- gradient_accumulation_steps: 1
- optimizer: AdamW with betas=(None, None), weight_decay=None and epsilon=None
- lr_scheduler: None
- lr_warmup_steps: 250
- ema_inv_gamma: None
- ema_inv_gamma: None
