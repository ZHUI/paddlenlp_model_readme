## README([From Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/thibaud/controlnet-sd21-color-diffusers))


Here's the first version of controlnet for stablediffusion 2.1 for diffusers
Trained on a subset of laion/laion-art

### Color:
![![<color> 0](https://huggingface.co/thibaud/controlnet-sd21/resolve/main/example_color.png)


### Misuse, Malicious Use, and Out-of-Scope Use

The model should not be used to intentionally create or disseminate images that create hostile or alienating environments for people. This includes generating images that people would foreseeably find disturbing, distressing, or offensive; or content that propagates historical or current stereotypes.
